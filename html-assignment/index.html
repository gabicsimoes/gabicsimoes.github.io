        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Gabriela, but I prefer to be called Gabi. I'm 27 years old and this is my second graduation. My 1<sup>st</sup> university was in <abbr title="Brazil">BR</abbr>, my home country, and where I was born and lived until a month ago, my first program at university was Architecture and Urban Planning. I also did a post-graduate program in Interior Design.</p>
        <p>I chose this program <em>to find myself a little bit</em> as a professional and because I thought I had some contact in the design field already, but nothing compares to this program because I was never in touch with either these software programs or design as a main product, just a section of design, and because of that, <em>I'm here willing to learn.</em></p>
